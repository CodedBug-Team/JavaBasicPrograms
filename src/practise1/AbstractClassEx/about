Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
It needs to be extended and its method implemented.
It cannot be instantiated.

It can have constructors (if it can't instantiated then what is need of constructor ???)
Ans: 1. The main objective of constructor in abstract class is to perform initialization of instance variable,
    which are inherit from abstract class in child class.
    2. Main objective of constructor in abstract class is CODE RE-USEABILITY.
