new is a keyword in java

Use Case: to create new object of class

Constructor
Use case: to initialise the class object.

-> In the given example we only created child class object but both parent and child class constructor is
    executed.

=> Child constructor and Parent Constructor
->Whenever we create new object for child constructor then its parent's constructor will automatic executed but
    their is no diffrent object will create for parent class. (See Hash Code in Example).

->so we can say that constructor's job is to initialize the class object not to creating new object of the
    class.

=> Constructor in Abstract Class:
-> Abstract class cannot be instantiated.
-> Abstract Class can have constructors (if it can't instantiated then what is need of constructor ???)
Ans: 1. The main objective of constructor in abstract class is to perform initialization of instance variable,
    which are inherit from abstract class in child class.
    2. Main objective of constructor in abstract class is CODE RE-USEABILITY.

the classes which are extends with without constructor abstract class, we have to initiate abstract class's
variable because its child class's responsibility to initiate abstract variables. If we have large nos of
variables in abstract class and large no of child class who extend that abstract class at that time our
code become to large.
So we use constructor in Abstract class, because if we make constructor then its constructor's responsibility
to initialize the variables.
