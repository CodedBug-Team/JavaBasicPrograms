Static Keyword: Static is a keyword which can be use before any Variable, Method and Block of code.
Use Case:
-> it is use when there is no need of allocating memory to each instance of any variable.
-> memory assign to static variable only once and each operation for that variable replace the previous value again and again.

In our example there is two variable one is with static keyword(count1) and another is without static keyword(count2).
When we increment value of both variable then we can se that the value of count2 is start with its initial value when
we create second object of the class but value of count1 is continue from its previous value instead of initial value.

So we can say that while creating second object of the same class memory is again allocated to count 1, but not to count1.
